# Denver-traffic-accidents

Description: This is the project folder that accompanies the dataset and notebook I put on Kaggle.
Contents: 
 - `notebooks` folder with `EDA` and `Munging the data` notebooks
 - `images` folder with images for both kaggle and github
 -  `src` folder with the contents of the munging notebook modified for production

Note: The data file is too large to put on Github but it resides [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hrokrin/denver-traffic-accidents)
